# TheorycraftClassic
This is a fix of the old Theorycraft addon to work with WoW Classic. I've began to maintain my own version of this fork separate from the Boothin repository because it was not actively being updated or fixed.

Use /tc to open the options window.

It is a work in progress and very incomplete. I am going to document a roadmap to bring it back to it's original glory.
